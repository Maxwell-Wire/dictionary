# Dictionary
simple Python dictionary application

Python Programming Language: The entire script is written in Python.

JSON Handling: The json module is used to load and read data from a JSON file (data.json.json).

String Manipulation: Methods like lower(), title(), and upper() are used to handle case-insensitive word matching.

Difflib Library: The get_close_matches function from the difflib module is used to find close matches for user input, suggesting possible corrections for misspelled words.

User Input/Output: The input() function is used to take user input, and print() is used to display the output.

Conditional Logic: The script uses if, elif, and else statements to handle different cases of word lookup and user responses.

List Iteration: The script checks if the output is a list and iterates over it to print each item individually.
